## Synopsis

  SchedulEyes is an appointment optimization app focused on a fluid, friendly user experience. 

## Motivation

  Many education institutions rely on email, word-of-mouth, and other awkward and informal scheduling options for coordinating office hours availability.  SchedulEyes marries an asynchronous user experience with an intelligent back end to create a simple, powerful, and intuitive scheduling experience.

## MVP

  * Users can be students/mentors
  * They can register and login with unique information
  * Students and Mentors have different user experiences
  * Appointments are between half an hour and two hours long
  * Mentors can create appointment Slots, available to up to 5 students
  * Mentors and students can both view their Commitments on their profile pages
  * Mentors and students can both provide feedback about the Appointment, with a numerical rating and text description
  
## Access

  SchedulEyes is a web app supported on Chrome, Safari, IE8 and above, and Firefox.
